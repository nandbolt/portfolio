                            Graphing calculator: There were many hurdles that needed to
                            be overcome for the graphing calculator. The player had to
                            be able to type in any valid math function anywhere in the
                            level. The equation needed to be parsed into something that
                            could be evaluated so that it could be graphed. Lastly, the
                            graph should be interactable by the player in a physically
                            believeable way.

                            Procedural human animations: For some reason I decided to
                            make the player character into a procedural animated human.
                            This meant I made classes for each limb type, cobbled them
                            together into a human and created animations based on their
                            movements. I also utilized inverse kinematics for the joints.
