            Hello there! My name is Alexander Wilson, but I also go by the developer name 
            <a href="https://nandbolt.itch.io/">nandbolt</a>. I aspire to make great video
            games, so that entails honing my 
            skills in many areas, from making physics engines that simulate complex 
            behaviors to designing GUI systems that are interactive and reuseable.
            That also means I need to dip my hands in the more artistic areas as well
            such as music creation and graphic arts, but the main focus of this website is to
            demonstrate my programming and game design skills.
        </p>
        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            I am currently a 4th year student majoring in computational physics at
            The University of Texas at Austin and aspire to become a professional game
            developer and software engineer. I've had a passion for math and science all
            throughout my life, and learning in highschool about the fundamental way physics
            uses math to explain real-world phenomena motivated me to study the subject
            in college. However, at the tail-end of highschool I started to learn more about
            the world of programming and software that was entirely new to me from a fellow
            classmate that was heavily interested in the subject. I began to learn on my own
            over time about the various different programming languages and technologies that
            developers used to create software. Throughout the learning process, I ended up trying
            out so many different languages and technologies and learned so much about how
            software is made.
        </p>
        <p>
            Throughout this process I began to understand what I wanted to become as a developer
            as well as what I wanted to create with my newfound programming knowledge. Growing up,
            I loved playing video games. They impacted my life greatly, allowing me to exercise
            my young mind through the conquering of various challenges they presented in their
            gameplay. Not only that, but they allowed for me to socialize with others in
            multiplayer as I played them with my brothers, parents, friends and random people
            all throughout the world. While I understand the childish nature games may
            represent to adults, I believe that games have incredible power and how popular
            video games are in modern society is proof of that. That is why I aim to make
            games: in the hopes of making something that can impact someone's life in the
            way that they've already impacted mine.
        </p>
        <p>
            This strive to become an "indie" game developer has led me to prioritize the process
            and ultimate end-goal of making a game rather than other programming practices.
            This means that most of my projects use game engines rather than being built from
            scratch with more general-purpose languages to speed up the development process
            and, in some ways, delegate alot of work to the developers of the game engines
            themselves. Specifically GameMaker, a 2D focused game engine that I've developed a
            fondness and competancy with. It was the engine that introduced me into game
            development in the senior year in highschool. After trying various other
            game engines and programming languages, I somehow ended back up at GameMaker so
            that is what I mainly use today and is the source of most of my games and projects.
            I know how GameMaker is looked down upon compared to other "real" development
            environments like Unity or Unreal, but I believe that good games can come from
            anywhere. I wanted to use something to make games; I didn't want to need something
            to make games. GameMaker is a fine tool to make games, and that is evident since
            some of my favorite games were made in it.
