                My name's Alex! What awaits you is a selection of projects and experiences that showcase my abilities as a
                software engineeer, and some as a game designer. Up above is a game made entirely
                in JavaScript as well, so if you get bored maybe give it a go!

                <p>
                    I studied computational physics in university. With math, science and video games as much of the driving force, I 
                    developer and software engineer. I've had a passion for math and science all
                    throughout my life, and learning in highschool about the fundamental way physics
                    uses math to explain real-world phenomena motivated me to study the subject
                    in college. However, at the tail-end of highschool I started to learn more about
                    the world of programming and software that was entirely new to me from a fellow
                    classmate that was heavily interested in the subject. I began to learn on my own
                    over time about the various different programming languages and technologies that
                    developers used to create software. Throughout the learning process, I ended up trying
                    out so many different languages and technologies and learned so much about how
                    software is made.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Throughout this process I began to understand what I wanted to become as a developer
                    as well as what I wanted to create with my newfound programming knowledge. Growing up,
                    I loved playing video games. They impacted my life greatly, allowing me to exercise
                    my young mind through the conquering of various challenges they presented in their
                    gameplay. Not only that, but they allowed for me to socialize with others in
                    multiplayer as I played them with my brothers, parents, friends and random people
                    all throughout the world. While I understand the childish nature games may
                    represent to adults, I believe that games have incredible power and how popular
                    video games are in modern society is proof of that. That is why I aim to make
                    games: in the hopes of making something that can impact someone's life in the
                    way that they've already impacted mine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This strive to become an "indie" game developer has led me to prioritize the process
                    and ultimate end-goal of making a game rather than other programming practices.
                    This means that most of my projects use game engines rather than being built from
                    scratch with more general-purpose languages to speed up the development process
                    and, in some ways, delegate alot of work to the developers of the game engines
                    themselves. Specifically GameMaker, a 2D focused game engine that I've developed a
                    fondness and competancy with. It was the engine that introduced me into game
                    development in the senior year in highschool. After trying various other
                    game engines and programming languages, I somehow ended back up at GameMaker so
                    that is what I mainly use today and is the source of most of my games and projects.
                    I know how GameMaker is looked down upon compared to other "real" development
                    environments like Unity or Unreal, but I believe that good games can come from
                    anywhere. I wanted to use something to make games; I didn't want to need something
                    to make games. GameMaker is a fine tool to make games, and that is evident since
                    some of my favorite games were made in it.

                            This meant I made classes for each limb type, cobbled them
                            together into a human and created animations based on their
                            movements. I also utilized inverse kinematics for the joints.
