                    My name's Alex. What awaits you is a selection of projects and experiences that, to me, showcase my abilities as a
                    software engineer, and some as a game designer. I had a blast putting this together and making this website from scratch, so I hope you enjoy your time here!<br/><br/>(COMING SOON: For the intrepid, there is a hidden golden egg on every page. Have fun collecting!)<br/><br/>(Website last updated 4/5/2025)

                        <b class="highlight">TL;DR: I studied physics, love video games and want to work in game development as both a software engineer and game designer.</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I grew up in El Paso, Texas. I always thought I'd be a scientist, growing up loving to learn about all of the interesting phenomena in this world, from the mysteries of deep-sea creatures to the inner workings of electromagnets. I also thoroughly enjoyed solving math problems and the certainty of their solutions, so physics seemed like the perfect thing to pursue heading into college.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, I discovered programming near the end of highschool through game development tutorials with GameMaker, a relatively beginner-friendly 2D game engine. I had zero programming experience before this and never considered programming or game development as a viable career for me even though I grew up playing and loving video games.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Slowly over time I began to fall in love with game development and learned to program because of this, creating several games and meeting tons of awesome people through this process. I shifted from plain physics to computational physics, pursued the Elements of Computing certificate and took the 2D Game Development Capstone at UT just so I could program and think about game development more.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now, nearing the end of my educational career, I hold my head high. I yearn to work in the game development industry, whether its to help program and solve software problems or design game systems and loops that players have no chance of escaping. With a unique background and interests, I hope to bring a fresh perspective on the industry. <b class="highlight">Eternally cursed, I drift towards the sun and close my eyes, focusing on the breeze flowing between my fingers.</b>
